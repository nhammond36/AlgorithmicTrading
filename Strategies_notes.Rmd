## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

PART ONE; Insurance. hedgin, and simple strategies
## chapter 2 Introduction to forwards and options
## Chapter 3 Insurance, collars, and other strategies
3.1 Basic insurance strategies
Infinite ways to combine options to create different payofss
1. Buy insurance. Insure long or short asset positions
2. Sell insurance.write options against an asset position

Four positions:
- Long the asset  with purchased put or written call 
- Short the asset  with purchased call or written put
\emph{Floors}, insuring a long position
Example own an index, purchase a put. The purchase of the put is a \textbf{floor} that guarantees 
a minimum sale price for the value of the index

\emph{Caps}, insuring a short position
Example short an index, purchase a call to protect agaainst preurchasing index at higher price. Buying the call option is called a \textbf{cap}. 

3.2 Synthetic forwards
put call parity

The net cost of buying the inde using options must equal the net cost of buying the index with the forward contract 
The present value of buying the index in the future is the PV of the forward price $PV(F_{0,T})$

If uses options the present value of the cost is the net option premium for buying the calland selling the put, call(K,T)-put(K,T)  + PV(k)
\begin{align*}
PV(F_{0,T})=[call(K,T)-put(K,Y)]  + PV(k)

call(K<T)-put(K,T)=PV(F_{0,T}=K)
\end{align*}
3.3 Speculating on volatility
\emph{Straddles}
\emph{Butterfly spreads}
\emph{Assymmetric Butterfly spreads}
