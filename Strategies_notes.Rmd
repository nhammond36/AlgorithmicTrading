This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Derivatives MARKETS Robert L. McDonald
PART ONE; Insurance. hedgin, and simple strategies
## chapter 2 Introduction to forwards and options
2.1 Forward contracts.Set today the terms at which you buy or sell an asset at a specific time in the future
A \tesxtbf{forward contract} sets tpday the terms at which you buy or sell an asset or commodity (the underlying asset) at a specific time in the future. (Deriv p21)
The time at which the contract settles is the expiration date
Long position:makes money when price goes up
Long position:makes money when price goes down

Payoff to long position: Spot price at expiration - forward price
Payoff to short position: Forward price - spot price at expiration

Comparing a forward out outright purchase:
Both positions give ownership of the example of an S&P index after  months: We can compare them fairly if we equate the amounts initially invested and then account for the interest earned over the six months -- in two equivalent ways:
1. Invest $\$1000$ in zero coupon bonds (e.g. Tbills) along with the forward contract in which case each position initially cost $\$1000$ at time 0
2. Borrow to buy the physical S$\&$R index, in which case each position initially costs $\$0$ at time 0.

## Chapter 3 Insurance, collars, and other strategies
3.1 Basic insurance strategies
Infinite ways to combine options to create different payofss
1. Buy insurance. Insure long or short asset positions
2. Sell insurance.write options against an asset position

Four positions:
- Long the asset  with purchased put or written call 
- Short the asset  with purchased call or written put
\emph{Floors}, insuring a long position
Example own an index, purchase a put. The purchase of the put is a \textbf{floor} that guarantees 
a minimum sale price for the value of the index

\emph{Caps}, insuring a short position
Example short an index, purchase a call to protect agaainst preurchasing index at higher price. Buying the call option is called a \textbf{cap}. 

3.2 Synthetic forwards
put call parity

The net cost of buying the inde using options must equal the net cost of buying the index with the forward contract 
The present value of buying the index in the future is the PV of the forward price $PV(F_{0,T})$

If uses options the present value of the cost is the net option premium for buying the calland selling the put, call(K,T)-put(K,T)  + PV(k)
\begin{align*}
PV(F_{0,T})=[call(K,T)-put(K,Y)]  + PV(k)
call(K<T)-put(K,T)=PV(F_{0,T}-K)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Synthetic forwards}
Mimic a long forward position on an asset: buy a call, sell a putoptions with sme strike price and time to expiration. At expiration, obliged to buy the asset just like a forward

The synthetic long forward differed from actual forward:
1. The forward contract has 0 premium, while the synthetic forwardrequires we pay the net option premium
2. With  the forward contract, pay the forward price, with the synthetic forward pay the strike price.


3.3 Spreads and collars
strategies using two or more options
An option spread is a position consisting of only calls or puts, some are purchased and some written
\emph{Bull and bears spreads} or vertical spreads
Bull spread. Buy a call and  sell identical call with higher strike price :
Buy low strike call sell an high strike call OR 
Buy low strike put sell an high strike put 

Bear spread, the opposite of bull spread
\emph{Box spreads}
Use options to create a synthetic long forward at one price  and a synthetic short forward at a different price
\emph{Ratio spreads}
Buy m calls at one price and  sell n calls at different strike price. Same time to maturity, same underlyiing asset
\emph{Collars}
purchase put, sell call with a higher strike price, Same expiration date, same underlying asset


3.4 Speculating on volatility
\emph{Straddles}
Buy a call and a put at same strike price and time to expiration
A bet that volatility will be high
\emph{Strangle}
\emph{Butterfly spreads}
\emph{Assymmetric Butterfly spreads}
